# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for suspected security vulnerabilities.

Preferred: use the repository's private vulnerability reporting flow (for example, GitHub Security Advisories).

If private reporting is not available, open an issue with minimal details and clearly mark it as security-sensitive so maintainers can coordinate a private channel.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release is supported with security fixes.
